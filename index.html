      <h1>Join the revolution</h1>
      Blockfire is a decentralised storage platform. Just like S3 or
      Snowflake you upload your file though the web interface or via the API.
      However unlike the traditional services the Blockfire than distributes the
      data across the Blockfire network nodes. Using this mechanism the data is
      stored in an ultra secure environment for very cheap and without any
      downtime. The Blockfire network also copies the files across multiple
      locations across its network and thus the system also works like a CDN
      enabling low latency connections. The system is essantially a CDN network
      built on top of a blockchain enabling higher capacity for lower cost. The
      Blockfire network is the world's first decentralised hosting service. The
      service has a central server only to store and distribute the data so the
      server acts only as a node balancer.

      <h1>How does it work?</h1>
      Blockfire has a server which distributes the data to its network nodes.

      The network nodes are miners that run the Blockfire client.

      Definition: Mining is the process of providing your SSD or HDD as a service to the Blockfire network.
      Blockfire uses the network storage providers' local storage to store the data.

      The subject network nodes are connected to the central server through a HTTP Socket connection and periodically communicate with the central server.

      When the Blockfire server receives the data it uses the socket connections command the relevant network nodes to stream the data directly to the target. Thus allowing Blockfire to be able to work with extremely low bandwith. The connections are identified using a unique identifier key.

      Files are encoded and split into smaller pieces and distributed across the network allowing no single network node to have an entire file making it impossible to decrypt.

      Its decentralised architecture makes it up to 1000 times more efficient and cheaper compared to any of the competitors due to almost non-existent broadband cost due to its extremely distributed network working like a huge CDN.
